YouTube offers some good Flash players to embed a channel on a site, and also offers an HTML5 player to play videos on platforms not supporting Flash, namely iPhone and iPad.

However, I've found no embeddable channel player that works on iPad, so I wrote this one.

To use it, you just need the js file, that only depends on jquery, version 1.5 or higher. You might want to use also the provided css file. Have a look at the demo HTML page for a simple example.
